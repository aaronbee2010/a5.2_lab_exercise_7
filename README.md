# Lab exercise 7 for A5.2 live session

## This exercise has been developed and tested with:
* PHP 8.3.9 (available on PATH) - PHP 8.2+ is required for PHPUnit
* Xdebug 3.3.2 - required IF generating code coverage reports with PHPUnit
* Composer 2.7.7

## Setup
The dependencies for this project can be installed by running the following command, assuming you have composer available on PATH:

`composer install`

# Run
Note: When generating code coverage reports with PHPUnit, the .gitignore file assumes you're saving the reports to tests/coverage.
